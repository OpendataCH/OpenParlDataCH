2. Group obstacles and weight them: What we need to address is clear
3. Funding possibilities are collected
4. Proceeding till the end of September has consent 
5. How we work together is clarified
#### Notes with actions
1. `We make harmonised Swiss parliamentary data accessible as an open web service.` <br>
<br>
Discussion:
* not only as a service, but also as a bulk download
* better "federated"
* caveat to 'free': pure DB yes / more: no
* caveat: what data are we talking about; calculated data, too?
   * no caculated values; nothing that is derived
   * only if already structured available
* the data that the parliaments already publish, but fundamentally normalised:
   * parliamentarians with ID, party, commission ..
   * Parliamentary affairs with ID, title, description ..
   * voting behaviour
   * vested interests (Confederation; .. and cantons if available)
* API: rate limit?
